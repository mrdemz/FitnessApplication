        <item>Make sure the padding on your thighs is firm to keep you stable. You are in a slightly hollow back position and use the wide handle from above.</item>
        <item>Bend your upper body like the video and keep your lower back straight.</item>
        <item>Use the wide overhand grip on the outside for maximum stress on the latissimus. You cross your feet behind you and pay attention to the posture of your body like in the video.</item>
        <item>Bend forward so that your back is almost horizontal. Your upper back area is only slightly higher than the lower. Instead of the flat bench, you can also use two sturdy chairs or stools.  </item>

        <item>With a slight hollow back, you lie down on the flat weight bench and always bring the barbells straight up.</item>
        <item>You lie down in a slightly hollow back on the flat weight bench and move the dumbbells vertically up and down.</item>
        <item>To avoid overloading the elbows and wrists, you have to bend them inward a little. As before, sit upright on the backrest and just move your arms back and forth.</item>
        <item>Grip the dumbbell in the middle with both fists. Postition in a strong arched back position and your legs are at right angles.</item>

        <item>Place the weight bench in the middle so that the bar is a bit in front of your head. The backrest is almost upright and you stay with your back at the very back of the backrest.</item>
        <item>The backrest on the back is set as in the video so that it is almost vertical. Sit upright with your upper body and go into a slightly hollow back position.</item>
        <item>Stand upright, shoulder width apart and in a slightly curved back posture. It is also important here that you do not fully straighten your arms, but leave a small bend in your elbows.</item>
        <item>Grip the bar with the width of your hips during the workout. If you grasp the barbell as wide as in the video, you only challenge your shoulder muscles.</item>

        <item>Take the SZ dumbbell from the dumbbell stand and slowly sit down. Sit close to the upholstery and as upright as possible. Hold the bar a little closer than hip width and keep your elbows on the shelf at all times.</item>
        <item>In the video above you can see that your elbow is below your knee on the inner thigh. This means that your upper arm remains vertical and you can concentrate fully on the muscle stimulus.</item>
        <item>You bend your upper body a little forwards to get a better grip on your triceps. Make sure that your upper arms are always vertical and that your elbows are close to your body.</item>
        <item>You keep your upper body upright as before and cross your feet for stability. As before with the triceps training, your head always remains upright.</item>

        <item>Take the barbell from a dumbbell stand on your upper back and stand shoulder-width apart. Now initiate the downward movement by moving your buttocks backwards. Only take enough weight to get the barbell squat clean.</item>
        <item>Your upper body and head always stay upright and the foot and knee of your supporting leg point 45 degrees forward. You mark the step width before the actual execution so that it corresponds to the picture and the video.</item>
        <item>Choose the stride length so that your front knee does not look over the tips of your toes.</item>
        <item>Your knees and toes look in the same direction, 45 degrees forward. The distance between your feet is two feet wider than shoulder width to the left and right. Keep your arms straight and grab the dumbbell at the top of the weight plate.</item>
